Multi-agent systems can be considered a natural paradigm when mod-
eling various transportation systems, whose management involves solving hard,
dynamic, and distributed allocation problems. Such problems have been studied
for decades, and various solutions have been proposed. However, even the most
straightforward resource allocation mechanisms lead to debates on efficiency vs.
fairness, business quality vs. passenger’s user experience, or performance vs.
robustness. We aim to design an analytical tool that functions as a recommenda-
tion system for on-demand transport (ODT) authorities. This tool recommends
specific allocation mechanisms that match the authority’s objectives and prefer-
ences to solve allocation problems for particular contextual scenarios. The paper
emphasizes the need for transparency and explainability of resource allocation
decisions in ODT systems to be understandable by humans and move toward a
more controllable resource allocation. We propose in this preliminary work a
multi-agent architecture and general implementation guidelines towards meeting
these requirements.
