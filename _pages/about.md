I earned my Ph.D. degree from the University of Lyon in 2020 and subsequently served as a member of the teaching staff at Télécom Saint-Etienne and a member of the "Image analysis and understanding" team at Hubert Curien Laboratory.

During my time in academia, I focused my research efforts on cutting-edge areas such as object detection, image classification, domain generalization, and explainable artificial intelligence. Through my research, I was able to develop a deep understanding of these subjects and make meaningful contributions to the advancement of the field.

Recently, I took on an even more challenging role as a full-time Stay-at-Home New Mom to my gorgeous baby girl. As the proud mother of my first child, I made the difficult decision to take a break from my professional career and devote my time to my family. While I may not be in the lab or the classroom, I remain passionate about my research interests and am eager to stay up to date on the latest advancements in the field. So whether I'm changing diapers or reading the latest research articles, I'm confident that I will make significant contributions to any future projects in these areas.
