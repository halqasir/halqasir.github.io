I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Lyon in 2020. I am a member of the teaching staff at Télécom Saint-Etienne, 
and a member of the &quot;Image analysis and understanding&quot; team of Hubert Curien Laboratory. 

My research interests include object detection, image classification, domain generalization, and explainable artificial intelligence.
