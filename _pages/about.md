I earned my Ph.D. degree from the University of Lyon in 2020 and subsequently served as a member of the teaching staff at TÃ©lÃ©com Saint-Etienne and a member of the "Image analysis and understanding" team at Hubert Curien Laboratory.

During my time in academia, I focused my research efforts on cutting-edge areas such as object detection, image classification, domain generalization, and explainable artificial intelligence. Through my research, I was able to develop a deep understanding of these subjects and make meaningful contributions to the advancement of the field.

Recently, I embarked on a rewarding role as a full-time Stay-at-Home New Mom, embracing the joy of motherhood and dedicating myself to my family. 

Now, transitioning back into the professional sphere, I'm currently engaged in a Project Management training courseâ€”a step driven by my curiosity and eagerness to expand my career horizons. This training offers an opportunity to broaden my skill set and gain insights into the Project Management domain, which I believe will be invaluable in my professional journey. This new chapter aligns with my passion for strategic planning, problem-solving, and collaborative leadership. I'm excited to immerse myself in this training, welcoming fresh insights that will complement my existing expertise and be readily applicable to future pursuits.

# Little "first name" update 

You might have known me as **Hiba**, but guess what? I've given my first name an update!
No worries, my old first name isn't going anywhereâ€”it's just getting a new buddy, paying homage to my multicultural background. 
From now on, you can call me by my old first name, **Hiba**, or by my new french addition, **ChloÃ©**.
In official documents you might spot both names hanging out together, side by side. But in our casual chats and friendly exchanges, feel free to use whichever name you prefer or find easier to pronounce.
When it comes to citations and academic references, I'll stick with my old first name to avoid any confusion. Consistency is key in the world of research, after all. ðŸ˜‰
